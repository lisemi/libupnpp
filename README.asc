=== libupnpp : a C++ wrapper for libupnp

libupnpp defines useful objects over libupnp and can be used to create both
devices and control points. It is shared by upmpdcli and upplay.

There is not much documentation at this point, but the include files are
somewhat commented, and there are a bunch of small sample programs (both
for the control and device side) in the libupnpp-samples github repository.

And also more complete examples with upmpdcli and upplay.
